PubMed is an online repository of references and abstracts of publications in the fields of medicine and life sciences

easyPubMed is an R interface to the Entrez Programming Utilities aimed at allowing an easy and smooth programmatic access
to PubMed. The package is suitable for batch downloading large volumes of records (via the batch_pubmed_download() function), 
and comes with a set of functions to perform basic processing of the PubMed query output. easyPubMed can request and handle 
PubMed records in either XML or TXT format.

Installation
To install easyPubMed from CRAN, you can run the following line of code

##install.packages("easyPubMed")

Before using the functions included in easyPubMed, make sure to load the library.

##library(easyPubMed)

Getting started - Retrieving data from PubMed
The first section of this tutorial covers how to use easyPubMed for querying Entrez and how to retrieve or download PubMed records
from the Entrez History Server.

Saving the query
##my_Search <- 'Damiano Fantini[AU] AND "2018"[PDAT]'

PubMed is queried via the get_pubmed_ids() function, which takes a Query string as argument
##my_entrez_id <- get_pubmed_ids(my_search)

Data can be retrieved from the History Server via the fetch_pubmed_data() function. The records can be requested in either XML or TXT format.
##my_abstracts_txt <- fetch_pubmed_data(my_entrez_id, format = "abstract")

head of abstract
##head(my_abstracts_txt)
